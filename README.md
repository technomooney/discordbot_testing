# discordbot_testing
just messing with making a discord bot with the end goal of being able to use the radio-browser.info api to play any radio station in a discord call...


this is also just something i can say i did on my own while just reading docs and some basic tutorials on the web...


this code needs a ".env" file in the same location as the pyw file. it will contain the discord bot token and other stuff that is specific to your system. i will update this when i get a mostly finalised .env file with all the prerequisite entries or ill make a setup script to make the file for users.
